# Flatbuffers reflection library

## Building generated files

Run `./generated_files.sh`.

As a prerequisite, you must have the `flatc` flatbuffer compiler installed. If you need to install it or the system version does not match the expected one, set `DOWNLOAD_FLATC=<platform>` when running `generated_files.sh` (where `<platform>` is `mac` or `linux`).
